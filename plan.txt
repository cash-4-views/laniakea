The process:
1. Rebecca is informed by youtube that there is a new report available for download
2. We then get the content from the CMS in csv form
	* For now, we use filesystem, until we learn more about this
3. We then split the csv:
	* Firstly, we grab the section sorted by video id, ending at legend
	* Then we group rows together by their custom id
	* If a row doesn't have a custom id, we group it with other lonely rows
	* We then split the sorted document by custom id group
	------ come back here
	* We then generate individual csvs according to these groups
	* We then save these csvs to a database --- do research on csvs and database
		* How do we store the data? csv or json or what?
		* Each collection is a custom id group + date
		(alternative: each collection is a custom id group, document is a month)

4. We then make this data available for review and editing at a designated location
	* When the admin visits the review page, they are displayed all of the sorted data
	* The custom id field for each row is editable via a text input field
	* 'Pon clicking the respective save button,
		i. first, we update the custom id
		ii. we then rewrite it to the new collection based on the custom id and month
		iii. we then delete it from its current collection
	* The page then re-renders with the updated data (all o' it?)

	* Each id group has an 'approve' button, which
		i. makes that data available for download at the client's account page
		ii. sends an email to the client notifying them of the available report, and containing
			* a link to their account page, which is a restricted area

5. Locations & authentication
	* USERS: Collection. Each document has:
		i. username (custom id or email or w/e)
		ii. hashed and salted password
		iii. email address
		iv. phone number
		v. rebecca status
	* ROUTES 		-	Auth:
		* Login page	- None
		* Logout 		- Client/Rebecca
		* Account page	- Client (custom id)
		* Admin page	- Rebecca


6. The client arrives at the login page, where they are shown a form with the following fields through which they can log in
	* username (custom id)
	* password
	* submit button
		* On submit, the login details are checked against our db
		* If found & correct, the client's session is set depending on privileges
		* They are then directed to their account page

7. The client arrives at the account page, where they are shown
	* A sorted list of months, with their corresponding reports available for download (button for download)
